# proto-kb

proto-kb is a web application that provides you the ability to visualize your desired keyboard layout.

This project was inspired by [keyboard-layout-editor](https://github.com/ijprest/keyboard-layout-editor), but our goal is to provide more flexible and convenient experience with more permissible license.
